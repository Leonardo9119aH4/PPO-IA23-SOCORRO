![What's New](https://phaser.io/images/github/div2-whats-new.png "What's New")

> 27th February 2024

The release of Phaser 3.80, affectionately dubbed "Nino," represents a significant leap forward in our quest to provide an even more powerful and versatile web game development framework. This update showcases our commitment to innovation, bolstered by the insightful feedback and contributions from our dedicated community and the tireless efforts of our development team.

Phaser 3.80 brings an array of new capabilities and improvements that enrich the developer experience. Among the highlights:

- **WebGL Context Loss Handling**: A robust solution to keep your games running smoothly, even in the face of WebGL context losses, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay.

- **Compressed Texture Improvements**: Added support for BPTC and RGTC file formats, sRGB color spaces and lots of updates around Mipmaps levels.

- **Base64 Loader Integration**: Allows for the loading of base64 encoded assets, facilitating smoother development processes for environments requiring embedded assets, like Playable Ads.

- **Scale Manager Snap Mode**: A new feature allowing developers to set a 'snapping' value for game dimensions, ideal for pixel-art games and those requiring precise scaling control.

- **Tilemap Enhancements**: Fixes and updates for tile collision and rendering, enhanced Tile to Sprite creation properties and more control over tile-based game elements.

With this release, we've implemented over **100 updates and bug fixes**, addressing community-reported issues and optimizing Phaser's performance and stability. These changes reflect our ongoing dedication to enhancing the framework's capabilities, ensuring developers have the tools they need to bring their creative visions to life.

At the same time as this release we also hit the **36,000 stars** milestone on GitHub, are used by over 32,000 developers and have over 550 contributors! These figures are a testament to the growing community of developers who have embraced Phaser as their go-to framework for web game development. We're grateful for the support and feedback we've received, and we're committed to continuing to evolve Phaser to meet the needs of our community.

We're excited for you to dive into Phaser 3.80 "Nino" and explore the new features and improvements. As always, we look forward to your feedback and contributions as we continue to evolve Phaser together. To make sure you read our weekly Developer Logs, please [subscribe to our free newsletter](https://phaser.io/community/newsletter/).

![Download Phaser](https://phaser.io/images/github/div2-download.png "Download Phaser")
<a name="download"></a>

Phaser is available via GitHub, npm and CDNs:

* Clone the git repository via [https][clone-http], [ssh][clone-ssh] or with the GitHub [Windows][clone-ghwin] or [Mac][clone-ghmac] clients.
* Download as [zip](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/archive/master.zip)
* Download the build files: [phaser.js][get-js] and [phaser.min.js][get-minjs]

### NPM

Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm install phaser
```

### CDN

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/phaser/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/phaser)

[Phaser is on jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/phaser) which is a "super-fast CDN for developers". Include the following in your html:

```html
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.80.1/dist/phaser.js"></script>
```

or the minified version:

```html
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.80.1/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>
```

### API Documentation

Go to https://newdocs.phaser.io/ to read the docs online. Use the links to navigate the namespaces, classes and Game Objects lists and also use the search box.

The documentation for Phaser is an on-going project. Please help us by contributing improved docs and examples.

### TypeScript Definitions

The [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/tree/master/types) can be found inside the `types` folder. They are also referenced in the `types` entry in `package.json`.

Depending on your project, you may need to add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
"lib": ["es6", "dom", "dom.iterable", "scripthost"],
"typeRoots": ["./node_modules/phaser/types"],
"types": ["Phaser"]
```

The TypeScript defs are automatically generated from the JSDoc comments found in the Phaser source code. If you wish to help refine them then you must edit the Phaser JSDoc blocks directly, not the defs file. You can find more details about the parser we built in the `scripts/tsgen` folder.

### Project Templates

You upload your server project using the Hathora console or CLI, and then dynamically create server instances in 10+ regions around the world. You get charged only for the duration of active matches/sessions. It's perfect for nodejs servers handling WebSocket connections, and takes care of SSL termination (for wss) and DDoS protection.

They have also published a [brand-new tutorial](https://bullet-mania.vercel.app/) on creating a scalable multiplayer Phaser game. If you think this could be useful for your hosting needs, join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hathora) to get in touch.

### Huge list of Phaser 3 Plugins

Super community member RexRainbow has been publishing Phaser 3 content for years, building up an impressive catalogue in that time. You'll find [loads of plugins](https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/index.html#list-of-my-plugins), from UI controls such as text input boxes, to Firebase support, Finite State Machines and lots more. As well as the plugins there is also a comprehensive set of 'Notes' about Phaser 3, going into great detail about how the various systems work. It's an invaluable resource and well worth checking out at [https://rexrainbow.github.io](https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/index.html)

### Create Your First Phaser 3 Example

Create an `index.html` page locally and paste the following code into it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.80.1/dist/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js"></script> 
</head>
<body>

    <script></script>

</body>
</html>
```

This is a standard empty webpage. You'll notice there's a script tag that is pulling in a build of Phaser 3, but otherwise this webpage doesn't do anything yet. Now let's set-up the game config. Paste the following between the `<script></script>` tags:

```javascript
const config = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: {
            gravity: { y: 200 }
        }
    },
    scene: Example
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
```

`config` is a pretty standard Phaser 3 Game Configuration object. We tell `config` to use the WebGL renderer if it can, set the canvas to a size of 800 x 600 pixels, enable Arcade Physics, and finally we tell it to use the Example Scene. This hasn't been implemented yet, so if you run this JavaScript code now you will have an error. Add the following above the `config`:

```javascript
class Example extends Phaser.Scene
{
    constructor ()
    {
        super();
    }

    preload ()
    {
        this.load.setBaseURL('https://labs.phaser.io');

        this.load.image('sky', 'assets/skies/space3.png');
        this.load.image('logo', 'assets/sprites/phaser3-logo.png');
        this.load.image('red', 'assets/particles/red.png');
    }

    create ()
    {
    }
}
```

Here we create a Scene called `Example`. We've given it 2 functions. The `preload` function is where you load assets into your game. In `preload`, we set the Base URL to be the Phaser server and load 3 PNG files.

The `create` function is empty, so it's time to fill it in:

```javascript
create ()
{
    this.add.image(400, 300, 'sky');

    const particles = this.add.particles(0, 0, 'red', {
        speed: 100,
        scale: { start: 1, end: 0 },
        blendMode: 'ADD'
    });

    const logo = this.physics.add.image(400, 100, 'logo');

    logo.setVelocity(100, 200);
    logo.setBounce(1, 1);
    logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);

    particles.startFollow(logo);
}
```

Here we add a sky image into the game and create a Particle Emitter. The `scale` value means that the particles will initially be large and will shrink to nothing as their lifespan progresses.

After creating the `emitter`, we add a logo image called `logo`. Since `logo` is a Physics Image, `logo` is given a physics body by default. We set some properties for `logo`: velocity, bounce (or restitution), and collision with the world bounds. These properties will make our logo bounce around the screen. Finally, we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo - so as the logo moves, the particles will flow from it.

Run it in your browser and you'll see the following:

(Got an error? Here's the [full code](https://gist.github.com/photonstorm/46cb8fb4b19fc7717dcad514cdcec064))

This is a tiny example, and there are hundreds more for you to explore, but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick Phaser is to use. With just a few easily readable lines of code, we've got something pretty impressive up on screen!

[![Ourcade](https://phaser.io/images/github/ourcade.jpg)](https://blog.ourcade.co)

Ourcade have published [two great Phaser 3 books](https://blog.ourcade.co). They'll take you from getting set-up, through to finishing your first game using modern JavaScript or TypeScript and they're both completely free!

Learn the secrets of HTML5 game development with Phaser 3.50 while building a cross platform endless runner game. Designed both for beginners and skilled programmers, the course guides you from an empty folder introducing the bare bones of JavaScript to advanced Phaser 3 features. Find out more details about [HTML5 Cross Platform Game Development with Phaser](https://gumroad.com/a/244184179).

![Building Phaser](https://phaser.io/images/github/div2-building-phaser.png "Building Phaser")

There are both plain and minified compiled versions of Phaser in the `dist` folder of the repository. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version is for production use. You can and should also create your own builds.

### Custom Builds

Phaser 3 is built using Webpack and we take advantage of the Webpack definePlugin feature to allow for conditional building of the Canvas and WebGL renderers and extra plugins. You can custom the build process to only include the features you require. Doing so can cut the main build file size down to just 70KB.

Read our [comprehensive guide](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser3-custom-build#creating-custom-phaser-3-builds) on creating Custom Builds of Phaser 3 for full details.

### Building from Source

If you wish to build Phaser from source, ensure you have the required packages by cloning the repository and then running `npm install` on your source directory.

You can then run `webpack` to create a development build in the `build` folder which includes source maps for local testing. You can also `npm run dist` to create a minified packaged build in the `dist` folder. For a list of all commands available use `npm run help`.
